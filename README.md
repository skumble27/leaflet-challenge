### Project Overview

Data relating to the incidences of Earthquakes throughout the planet have been meticulously documented by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and as commissioned by this organisation, a web based application has been developed in which users can visualise the data on the map to gain insight as to when and where the earthquakes have occurred. A sample of the web application has been provided below where users can lick on the circle markers to obtain further information on that particular event.

As further requested by the USGS, a second map was created that contains a layer provided the locations of the global tectonic plates. In this instance, the users have the option to view the location of these plates and their proximity to the areas in which the earthquakes have occurred. For further customisation options, the users can toggle between different map layers, as shown in the screen shot below:
